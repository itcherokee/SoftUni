Problem 1. What is SQL? What is DML? What is DDL? Recite the most important SQL commands.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for creating, altering and deleting a database and tables as well as a language for getting, inserting, updating and deleting (CRUD operations) data in table(s) within a database.

DDL part of the language deals with operations related to tables and database structure. Most important commands are CREATE, ALTER and DROP.

DML part of the language deals with operations related to data within the tables. Most important commands are SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE.

There is third part of the language that deals with the rights within database/tables called DCL (Data Control Language). Two commands are used GRANT and REVOKE.

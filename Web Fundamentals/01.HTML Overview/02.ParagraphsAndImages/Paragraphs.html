        <p>I love programming. I enjoy the challenge to not only make a working program,
            but to do so with style. Programming is like poetry. It conveys a message, not only
            to the computer, but to those who modify and use your program. With a program,
            you build your own world with your own rules. You create your world according
            to your conception of both the problem and the solution. Masterful programmers
            create worlds with programs that are clear and succinct,
            much like a poem or essay.</p>

        <p>One of the greatest programmers, <strong>Donald Knuth</strong>, describes programming not as
            telling a computer how to do something, but telling a person how they would
            instruct a computer to do something. The point is that programs are meant to be
            read by people, not just computers. Your programs will be modified and updated
            by others long after you move on to other projects. Thus, programming is not as
            much about communicating to a computer as it is communicating to those who
            come after you. A programmer is a problem-solver, a poet, and an instructor all at
            once. Your goal is to solve the problem at hand, doing so with balance and taste,
            and teach your solution to future programmers. I hope that this book can teach at
            least some of the poetry and magic that makes computing exciting.</p>

        <p>Most introductory books on programming frustrate me to no end. At the end of
            them you can still ask "how does the computer really work?" and not have a good
            answer. They tend to pass over topics that are difficult even though they are
            important. I will take you through the difficult issues because that is the only way
            to move on to masterful programming. My goal is to take you from knowing
            nothing about programming to understanding how to think, write, and learn like a
            programmer. You won’t know everything, but you will have a background for how
            everything fits together.</p>

            <h3>Computer Architecture</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Before learning how to program, you need to first understand how a computer
            <em>interprets</em> programs. You don’t need a degree in electrical engineering, but you
            need to understand some basics.</p>

        <p>Modern computer architecture is based off of an architecture called the <em>Von
            Neumann architecture</em>, named after its creator. The Von Neumann architecture
            divides the computer up into two main parts - the <b>CPU</b> (for Central Processing
            Unit) and the <b>memory</b>. This architecture is used in all modern computers,
            including personal computers, supercomputers, mainframes, and even cell phones.</p>

            <h3>Structure of Computer Memory</h3>
        </header>
        <p>To understand how the computer views memory, imagine your local post office.
            They usually have a room filled with PO Boxes. These boxes are similar to
            computer memory in that each are numbered sequences of fixed-size storage
            locations. For example, if you have 256 megabytes of computer memory, that
            means that your computer contains roughly 256 million fixed-size storage
            locations. Or, to use our analogy, 256 million PO Boxes. Each location has a
            number, and each location has the same, fixed-length size. The difference between
            a PO Box and computer memory is that you can store all different kinds of things
            in a PO Box, but you can only store a single number in a computer memory
            storage location.</p>
        <pre>
    PO.Box 1    PO.Box 2    PO.Box 3    PO.Box 4    PO.Box 5
    ...
    PO.Box 10   PO.Box 11   PO.Box 12 ...
        </pre>
        <i>Memeory locations are like PO Boxes.</i>

            <h3>Memory locations are like PO Boxes</h3>
        </header>
        <img src="images/ram.png" alt="Memory DIMM">

        <p>You may wonder why a computer is organized this way. It is because it is simple
            to implement. If the computer were composed of a lot of differently-sized
            locations, or if you could store different kinds of data in them, it would be difficult
            and expensive to implement.</p>

        <p>The computer’s memory is used for a number of different things. All of the results
            of any calculations are stored in memory. In fact, everything that is "stored" is
            stored in memory. Think of your computer at home, and imagine what all is stored
            in your computer’s memory. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The location of your cursor on the screen</li>
            <li>The size of each window on the screen</li>
            <li>The shape of each letter of each font being used</li>
            <li>The layout of all of the controls on each window</li>
            <li>The graphics for all of the toolbar icons</li>
            <li>The text for each error message and dialog box</li>
            <li>The list goes on and on...</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In addition to all of this, the Von Neumann architecture specifies that not only
            computer data should live in memory, but the programs that control the computer’s
            operation should live there, too. In fact, in a computer, there is no difference
            between a program and a program’s data except how it is used by the computer.
            They are both stored and accessed the same way.</p>

            <h3>The CPU</h3>
        </header>
        <img src="images/cpu.png" alt="Control Processing Unit">

        <p>So how does the computer function? Obviously, simply storing data doesn’t do
            much help - you need to be able to access, manipulate, and move it. That’s where
            the CPU comes in.</p>

        <p>The CPU reads in instructions from memory one at a time and executes them. This
            is known as the fetch-execute cycle.</p>
        The CPU contains the following elements to accomplish this:
        <ul>
            <li>Program Counter</li>
            <li>Instruction Decoder</li>
            <li>Data bus</li>
            <li>General-purpose registers</li>
            <li>Arithmetic and logic unit</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The program counter is used to tell the computer where to fetch the next
            instruction from. We mentioned earlier that there is no difference between the way
            data and programs are stored, they are just interpreted differently by the CPU. The
            program counter holds the memory address of the next instruction to be executed.
            The CPU begins by looking at the program counter, and fetching whatever number
            is stored in memory at the location specified. It is then passed on to the instruction
            decoder which figures out what the instruction means. This includes what process
            needs to take place (addition, subtraction, multiplication, data movement, etc.) and
            what memory locations are going to be involved in this process...</p>

// Task 01: Write a PHP script PrintTags.php which generates an HTML input text
//          field and a submit button. In the text field the user must enter
//          different tags, separated by a comma and a space (", "). When the
//          information is submitted, the script should split the tags, put them
//          in an array and print out the array. Semantic HTML is required.
//          Styling is not required.

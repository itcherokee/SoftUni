<?php
// Task 7:  ** Write a PHP program StudentSorting.php that receives data about several students from
//          an input form (first name, last name, email and grade) and prints it as an HTML table.
//          The user should be able to dynamically add/remove entries via the +/- buttons.
//          The data can be sorted by 4 criteria:  First name, Last name, Email and Exam score.
//          The sorting can be done in ascending/descending order. The result should be printed as a table.
//          The average exam score should be printed on the last row. (See the example below.)
//          Styling the page is optional. Semantic HTML is required. (Hint: Use objects to store the data.)
